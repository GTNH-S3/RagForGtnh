    "content": "GT New Horizons Enhanced Lootbags are usually obtained as Quest Book rewards, and drop Loot items according to their type. When enchanted with Fortune III (which also requires a tier-appropriate item) they will not have items from the Default loot pool. Some items drop as groups, such as dyes, saplings and ztones blocks. Despite being termed 'trash', the default loot pool includes some items otherwise quite difficult to obtain, such as the various Natura trees. Bag contents are mildly weighted, with an average 0.4-1% chance for any given drop from tiered lootbags, and a 0.6-2.5% chance for any specific item from Fortune III enchanted tiered bags."

Bag contents are mildly weighted, with an average 0.4-1% chance for any given drop from tiered lootbags, and a 0.6-2.5% chance for any specific item from Fortune III enchanted tiered bags. Naturally the smaller the loot pool, the greater the odds of getting any individual item out of it. Some lootbag items are limited to a total number of drops per player, for example all items in the Legendary - Unique bag. Limited drop counts are mostly used to prevent players from getting too many of an item that has greatly diminishing returns in multiples."

Items from this group can appear in any non-unique lootbag instead of a bag-specific item. Enchanting with Fortune III removes the chance of getting trash items completely.

When not enchanted with Fortune III, lootbags add all the items in this pool to their weighted drop table.
